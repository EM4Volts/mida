# MIDA - the Marathon tool that does (almost) everything

## What is this?

MIDA is a fork of [Charm](https://github.com/MontagueM/Charm/tree/delta/TFS) designed soley for Marathon

The tool focuses on providing as much access to the information in the game files as possible, **ideal for artists and content preservation**.
> [!CAUTION]
> # Disclaimer
> * Before you go any further, understand that Charm ***IS NOT*** a datamining tool! While it can access many things in the game files, it's main purpose is focused towards **3D artists, content preservation and learning how the game works**!
> * Please **DO NOT** use this tool to spread leaks and spoilers or anything that may break Bungie's TOS. Don't ruin the experience for yourself and others. Uncover things the way they were intended!
> * Seeing this tool used for such acts can and will result in fewer and fewer public updates and releases. I enjoy maintaining and updating this for others, don't be the one to ruin it.

## How do I install and use it?

You'll first need at least one game installation.
